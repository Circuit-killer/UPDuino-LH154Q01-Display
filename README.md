# UPDuino-LH154Q01-Display
Design to connect Lattice Ultraplus FPGA to LH154Q01 Display

UPDuino is an ultra low cost FPGA development and prototyping board.  The OV7670 Camera Module is an ultra low cost VGA camera module traditionally used for maker projects.  The UPDuino OV7670 Camera Module Adapter Board connects a OV7670 camera module to a UPDuino v2.0 board.  This page provide details on the hardware and software necessary to connect the OV7670 Camera module and an Arduino to a UPDuino board and stream image data from the Ultraplus FPGA frame buffer to a computer via UART.  The image data can then be copied into a file and be viewed as a bitmap.
